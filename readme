About:
  This is a Hartree-Fock implementation, based on Szabo/Ostlund's
  classic "Modern Quantum Chemistry".
  
  At the moment only Restricted HF is supported. The goal is to
  support RHF, UHF, and GHF, and eventually to support DFT or GF2
  as well.
  
  lapack is required. Eventually, OpenMP will be required as well.

  This only works on linux and macos.

Setup:
  1. run configure script
  2. run build script
  3. drink espresso
  4. that's it
