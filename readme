About:
  This is a Hartree-Fock implementation, based on Szabo/Ostlund's
  classic "Modern Quantum Chemistry". The Hartee-Fock method
  solves the many-body Schrodinger equation by assuming a single
  Slater determinant approximation for the many-body wavefunction.
  This describes first-order Coulomb and Exchange interactions
  exactly, but completely misses higher-order correlation effects.
  
  At the moment only Restricted HF is supported. The goal is to
  support RHF, UHF, and GHF, and eventually to support DFT or GF2
  as well.
  
  lapack is required. OpenMP is required on linux.

  This only works on linux and macos.


Setup:
  1. run configure script
  2. run build script
  3. drink espresso
  4. that's it
